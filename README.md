# Code Weekend 1

[![Build Status](https://github.com/jmerle/code-weekend-1/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/jmerle/code-weekend-1/actions/workflows/build.yml)

This repository contains my code for the [Code Weekend 1](https://codeweekend.dev/) competition.

I started with a basic C++ program ([`src/cw1/solvers/basic.cpp`](./src/cw1/solvers/basic.cpp)) that focused on collecting experience first and then gold, and ran a grid search on some thresholds that seemed important. I didn't put a lot of time into it, and it ended up doing pretty poorly (~70th at the 24h mark). I then decided to try something out-of-the-box and built a simple GUI that let me create solutions manually. This got me to 11th at the 32h mark, and 24th at the end of the competition.

The GUI is available here: [https://jmerle.github.io/code-weekend-1/](https://jmerle.github.io/code-weekend-1/)

Please note that the GUI was made for my 1920x1200 monitor, it may look a bit odd on other sizes and is not mobile-friendly.
